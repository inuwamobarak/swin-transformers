# swin-transformers
Swin Transformers, short for "Shifted Windows," were introduced in the paper titled "Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows" by Liu et a. (2021). Unlike traditional transformers, Swin Transformers divide the image into non-overlapping shifted windows, enabling efficient and scalable computation.
