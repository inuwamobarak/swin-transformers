# Swin Transformer for Masked Image Modeling

This repository demonstrates how to use a pre-trained Swin Transformer for Masked Image Modeling. Masked Image Modeling is a task where random patches in an image are masked out, and the model is trained to predict the masked patches. The Swin Transformer is a powerful hierarchical vision transformer designed for computer vision tasks.

Swin Transformers, short for "Shifted Windows," were introduced in the paper titled "Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows" by Liu et a. (2021). Unlike traditional transformers, Swin Transformers divide the image into non-overlapping shifted windows, enabling efficient and scalable computation.

## How It Works

1. We load an image from a URL using the PIL library.
2. The image is processed using the pre-trained Swin Transformer image processor (AutoImageProcessor).
3. A SwinForMaskedImageModeling model is loaded, pre-trained on the Swin Transformer architecture.
4. The image is divided into patches, and random patches are masked using a boolean mask.
5. The model is then trained to predict the masked patches given the rest of the image.
6. The model's reconstruction and loss are obtained for evaluation.

## Prerequisites

To run this code, you need the following libraries installed:

- `transformers`: The main library that provides the AutoImageProcessor and SwinForMaskedImageModeling classes.
- `torch`: The PyTorch library, essential for running the deep learning model and performing tensor computations.
- `PIL`: The Python Imaging Library, required for image processing.
- `requests`: For fetching the image from a URL.

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install transformers torch pillow requests
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the notebook to see how the Swin Transformer performs on the masked image modeling task.

```bash
python masked_image_modeling.py
```
3. The reconstructed pixel values and loss will be displayed, indicating the quality of the model's predictions.

## Example Output
